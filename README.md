# Audio Device Switcher

A lightweight Windows application for quick and easy switching between audio output devices. <br> 
Features global hotkeys, system tray operation, and external program control via Windows Registry. <br>
This utility simplifies the audio output device switching, which for some reason Windows have located in a "strange place" in the audio tray icon.<br>

3.  Run `Audio Device Switcher.exe`
4.  The application will appear in your system tray

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1.  **Switch devices**: Click any device in the list to make it default
2.  **System tray**: Double-click tray icon to show/hide window
3.  **Settings**: Click "Settings" button to customize behavior

### Setting Up Hotkeys

2.  Choose modifier keys (Ctrl/Alt/Shift) and main key
3.  Click OK to save
4.  Use the hotkey combination anytime to switch to that device

## External Program Control

Other applications can control Audio Device Switcher through Windows Registry commands:

### Switch to Device Examples

**Command Prompt:**

cmd

```cmd
reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\AudioDeviceSwitcher" /v "SwitchToAudioDevice" /t REG_SZ /d "D2" /f
```

**PowerShell:**

powershell

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\SOFTWARE\AudioDeviceSwitcher" -Name "SwitchToAudioDevice" -Value "D3"
```

### Registry Keys

Key

Purpose

Example Value

`CurrentAudioDevice`

Current device name (read-only)

"Speakers (Realtek Audio)"

`CurrentAudioDeviceID`

Current device ID (read-only)

"D2"

`SwitchToAudioDevice`

Command to switch device

"D5"

### How It Works

1.  Write a device ID (D1, D2, D3, etc.) to `SwitchToAudioDevice`
2.  Audio Device Switcher detects the change within 500ms
3.  Switches to the specified device
4.  Resets the registry value to "XX" to prevent repeated switches

Device IDs are shown in the "ID" column of the main application window.
